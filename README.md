# Flask-with-DB
### Flask gradeBookApp with database model integrated using SQLAlchemy + sqlite

With this project, I have made a flask based GradeBook app which stores a student's data along with the respective courses he has opted for.

The DB file consists of 3 tables - 
  - Student's table : It holds the details of each of the student. Details stored are -- student's ID, roll number, first and last name.
  - Course's table : It holds the course related details. Data has been manually fed to this table. Data fed includes the course's ID, name, code and a description of the course.
  - Enrollment's table : It basically holds the relationship between each student and his/her enrolled courses.
 
More details on how the project has been built in a systematic way are in the pdf file - Week5_LabAssignment.pdf
